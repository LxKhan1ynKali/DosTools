This repository contains a collection of offensive security research tools designed for authorized red team simulations, defensive validation, and blue team detection testing.
The tools here are not plug-and-play weapons. They are research artifacts, lab frameworks, and proof-of-concept implementations intended for:
Red Team adversary emulation
Blue Team detection & response testing
SOC / DFIR validation
Academic & controlled lab environments
⚠️ Unauthorized usage is strictly prohibited.
🎯 Purpose
This repository exists to:
Simulate real-world attack patterns in a controlled environment
Help defenders understand attacker methodologies
Improve detection, alerting, and response capabilities
Support ethical security research
All tools assume explicit authorization.
🧠 Intended Audience
Red Team Operators
Blue Team Analysts
SOC Engineers
Cybersecurity Researchers
Students learning offensive & defensive security
If you don’t understand what authorization means, do not use these tools.
⚙️ Usage Philosophy
These tools are intentionally non-automated and environment-dependent.
If something does not work:
It is not broken
It means you must understand the environment
Or you must ask the author
❗ If a tool fails, crashes, or behaves unexpectedly —
DO NOT modify it blindly.
Contact the author for guidance.
🧪 Lab & Environment Expectations
Custom lab setup required
No guarantee of compatibility across systems
Defensive controls (EDR, firewall, IPS) may block behavior
Tools may require adaptation per scenario
This is intentional.
🛡️ Legal & Ethical Notice
🚨 AUTHORIZED USE ONLY
You must have written permission from the system owner before using any tool in this repository.
